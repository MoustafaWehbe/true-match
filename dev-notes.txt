For the api running inside docker to access db running on host machine:
  - Update postgresql.conf: Find the listen_addresses setting and ensure it is set to '*' to allow connections from all IPs.
  - Update pg_hba.conf: Add an entry in pg_hba.conf to allow access from your Docker container’s subnet or IP range. For example:
  The IP range 172.17.0.0/16 is commonly used by Docker for its internal network, but you should verify this by running:
  - change the connection string from: 
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=127.0.0.1;Port=5434;Database=DAPP;User Id=postgres;Password=postgres;" 
    to:
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=host.docker.internal;Port=5434;Database=DAPP;User Id=postgres;Password=postgres;"

Logic:

I- Start Time Restrictions

  The room can only be started within 10 minutes of its scheduled start time. It cannot be started earlier or later than this window.
  For example, if the room is scheduled for 6:00 PM, the user can only start it between 6:00 PM and 6:10 PM.
  If the user attempts to start the room before the scheduled time, the app should display a message indicating, "It’s not time to start the room yet."
  If the user attempts to start the room after the 10-minute window, the app should display a message stating, "The room is no longer valid. Please create a new one."
  If the user has already started the room but is disconnected (e.g., due to connectivity issues), they should be allowed to rejoin as long as the room has not yet expired.

II- Room Expiry Logic

  The room is considered active until it expires. The expiry time depends on the scheduled start time and the total duration of the rounds.
  For instance, if the rounds take 30 minutes and the room is scheduled to start at 6:00 PM, the room will expire at 6:30 PM.
  However, since users are allowed to start the room up to 10 minutes late, the expiry time is adjusted based on the actual start time. For example:
  If the user starts the room at 6:05 PM, the room will expire at 6:35 PM.
  Automatic Expiry: At the expiry time, all participants will be removed from the room.

III- Pause Rounds Logic

  Users are allowed to pause the rounds, and each pause affects the expiry time.
  A maximum of 3 pauses, each lasting 15 seconds, is permitted per room.
  The expiry time is extended by the total pause duration:
  3 × 15 = 45 seconds

  For example, if the room is scheduled to start at 6:00 PM and the user starts it at 6:05 PM, the adjusted expiry time is:
  6:35:00+45 seconds = 6:35:45

  After the expiry time (including pauses), no one will be able to start or join the room.

IV- End Time Restrictions

  The room typically ends when all rounds are completed. However, if no participants join the room or if the rounds finish early (e.g., through quick completion or by using a "skip" button), the room remains active until its calculated expiry time.
  This ensures that users have sufficient time within the allowed window to complete their activities.

V- How many users can join?

  All users without a limit are allowed to enter the room after they show interest in joining (ie. presses the I am interested button). However, when the room starts, once it reaches 5 participants we should not allow more people to join..

VI- Users interested in joining

  They will receive an email/notification 10 minutes before the room's scheduled time. It is gonna be first come first serve. Only 5 of them are allowed to be in the room.
