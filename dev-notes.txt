For the api running inside docker to access db running on host machine:
  - Update postgresql.conf: Find the listen_addresses setting and ensure it is set to '*' to allow connections from all IPs.
  - Update pg_hba.conf: Add an entry in pg_hba.conf to allow access from your Docker containerâ€™s subnet or IP range. For example:
  The IP range 172.17.0.0/16 is commonly used by Docker for its internal network, but you should verify this by running:
  - change the connection string from: 
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=127.0.0.1;Port=5434;Database=DAPP;User Id=postgres;Password=postgres;" 
    to:
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=host.docker.internal;Port=5434;Database=DAPP;User Id=postgres;Password=postgres;"
